                                Unique Software 
                             Post Office Box 26613 
                            Fort Worth, Texas 76126 

                         Shareware and Unique Software 

    The ÿfiles ÿcontained herein are distributed on two concepts. ÿÿThe ÿfirst 
concept, ÿÿthe Shareware concept, ÿprovides that this software is to be freely 
distributed in an un-modified state. You are encouraged to copy, give, ÿupload 
any of our un-modified software to any person, ÿbulletin board or entity. ÿThe 
second ÿconcept, ÿÿwe ÿcall "Aware", ÿis that Unique Software ÿshould ÿprovide 
valuable, useful, and/or entertaining software, programming techniques, and/or 
information. 
    The first concept works only if the second concept is fulfilled by us. ÿWe 
do not require or set a "donation." ÿWe do not distribute software and ÿexpect 
"charity" ÿin return. ÿInstead, ÿwe only want payment from those who feel that 
our software, programming techniques, and/or information is valuable, ÿuseful, 
and/or entertaining. ÿThe amount? How valuable, useful, and/or entertaining is 
it to you? 
    We only ask two things from our users. ÿFirst, ÿthat you foward your ÿname 
and ÿaddress with any payment you might make. ÿ(This will enable us to ÿinform 
you ÿof any upgrade or bugs found.) ÿAlong with any suggestions or comments on 
the program. Second, Enjoy! 

                         Notice to users of GW-BASIC: 
    Some ÿversions ÿof GW-BASIC recently distributed with MS-DOS 3.2 ÿÿthrough 
Tandy have a "bug" in the PLAY statement. ÿIf an attempt is made to PLAY music 
in the background, PLAY "mb", GW-BASIC locks up. 
    In ÿorder to provide an alternative to people who only have this ÿversion, 
we have "coded" ÿaround the problem. If you experience "lock-up" trying to run 
this music file, after you re-boot type the following line at your DOS prompt: 
    SET MF=1 
    This disables the PLAY "mb" ÿstatments. ÿAlso note that this also disables 
the major portion, or ALL, "animation" features of some of our music programs.
