These are some GW-Basic programs to play music using the 3-voice chip on 
the Tandy 1000's.  I found them on America Online.  Four of these would not 
play as written on the 1000TL, so I debugged them.  Both the original and 
the debugged versions are included:

    BALLGAME.BAS        "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" (original)
    BALLGAM2.BAS        "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" (debugged)
    CRADLE.BAS          Lullabye tune
    DIXIE.BAS           "Dixie"
    DUELIN.BAS          "Duelling Banjos"
    REGGAE.BAS          "Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer" (original)
    REGGAE2.BAS         "Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer" (debugged)
    ROK&ROLL.BAS        Rock 'n' roll tune (original)
    ROK&ROL2.BAS        Rock 'n' roll tune (debugged)
    SCHOOL.BAS          "School Days" (original)
    SCHOOL2.BAS         "School Days" (debugged)
